# Heroku buildpack for JRuby

A buildpack to fast and easy use JRuby on Heroku. Just create a Heroku app like this:

    heroku create -s cedar --buildpack https://github.com/jruby/heroku-buildpack-jruby.git 

It will download and unpack JRuby from [jruby.org](http://jruby.org/), install [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and run ```bundle install``` and then use your ```Procfile```.

Example ```Procfile```:

    web: bin/trinidad -t -r -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV

Note: You do normally not want to use ```bundle exec``` with JRuby. Use the binstubs (in ```bin/```) instead, and put ```require 'bundler/setup'``` before any other ```require```.

Current JRuby version: 1.7.0

For now only supports 1.9 mode, open an issue if you need 1.8 mode.

Example application: [github.com/carlhoerberg/heroku-jruby-example](https://github.com/carlhoerberg/heroku-jruby-example)

## Assets

To get the assets precompiled during slug compilation take the following actions: 

1. Replace ```therubyracer``` with ```therubyrhino``` in the ```Gemfile``` (and then run ```bundle``` and commit)
1. Add ```config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false``` to ```config/application.rb``` 
1. Change ```config.serve_static_assets``` to ```true``` in ```config/environments/production.rb```
1. (Optional) Replace ```uglifier``` with ```closure-compiler``` and add ```config.assets.js_compressor = :closure``` to ```config/environments/production.rb```, to get faster compile times.

## Logging

To get Heroku to pick up Rails logs you have to add the following to ```config/environments/production.rb``` 

``` ruby
STDOUT.sync = true
config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) 
``` 

## Servers

Recommended web servers are:

* [Trinidad](https://github.com/trinidad/trinidad) - A wrapper around [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
* [Mizuno](https://github.com/matadon/mizuno) - A wrapper around [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/)
* [Puma](http://puma.io) - A server written in Ruby, wraps the Ragel parser (from Mongrel)

## Multithreading

To get the real benefits of JRuby you should enable multithreading, both in the application server of choice as well as in Rails. 

### Rails

Add ```config.threadsafe!``` to ```config/environments/production.rb``` 

### Trinidad

Add the ```--threadsafe``` flag as a command line argument to Trinidad. 

```web: bin/trinidad --threadsafe --rackup -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV```
